## TensorFlow1 version
- Title: Double JPEG Detection in Mixed JPEG Quality Factors using Deep Convolutional Neural Network

- Conference: The European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV)

- Data normalization is important. You should set the Y value having 0-255, not 0-1.

- Proposed network tensorflow code.

- Trained weights link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HlKSoCGVm_2Gia--MH5Bx3SquJos-kr1.

  The network was trained with two dataset. 
  
  First dataset was generated using 1120 quantization tables (mentioned in the paper). 
  
  Second dataset was generated using standard quantization tables (Q50 - Q100).


- Example code (application.py) is updated now.

  normal_galaxy_note8_1.jpg - normal image was captured by galaxy note8 smartphone.
  
  splicing_PQ10.jpg - manpulated image (splicing) was generated by Photoshop. 
  
  copy_move_PQ10.jpg - manpulated image (copy-move) was generated by Photoshop. 
  
  PQ# means save jpg quality factors in Photoshop.
